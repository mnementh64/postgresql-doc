# Checkpoints

##What's is a checkpoint ? 

[This is a good reading](https://blog.2ndquadrant.com/basics-of-tuning-checkpoints/) from 2nd quadrant.

Data are first written to WAL ([Write Ahead Log](/postgresql/wal_files/)) files before being copied to data files. That way to process ensures durability : in case of a crash, database will use WAL to recover data and write them to data files.

Users only have to wait for WAL files to be flushed to disk to have data available in DB. By this time, RAM cache could be used for users and be flushed to disk later. 

A checkpoint writes all dirty pages from memory to disk, marks them as â€œclean" in shared_buffers, and stores information that all of wal up to now is applied : WAL files are not needed before the checkpoint position.

In practice, we often want to find a good ratio between :

* having not too frequent checkpoints so IO for buffers is spread on a large amount of time
* but frequent enough to limit the recovery time after a crash and to limit the disk usage for WAL files 


##What trigger checkpoints ?

Basically, timeout or size :

* it's been more than the `checkpoint_timeout` value since previous checkpoint ended
* WAL folder (`/pgsql_folder/pg_xlog/` before version 10 or `/pgsql_folder/pg_wal/` since) if full. Its size could not be more than the `max_wal_size` value.

Checkpoints should be mostly triggered by timeout, not size.


##Spread checkpoints

Checkpoints is basically a writing to disk of dirty buffers. Its job must be done during a fraction of the checkpoint total time, fraction set by the `checkpoint_completion_target` parameters (0.5 by default).


##Checkpoint and Linux Cache

Linux cache by default can handle a great amount of data before flushing it to the storage. It could be harmful for the checkpoint process. If we tune the checkpoint to spread the writing on a quite long time and the OS cache get it and flush all at a single time, it will create an I/O pike. 

It could be better not to let the cache keep too much data and be force to flush it more frequently.

See [details on how to tune Linux Kernel](/postgresql/linux_tuning/#cache-tuning) for Database performance usage.


##Control activity

Of course, stats could be gathered. But also, a global status of the server is available by the command `/usr/lib/postgresql/9.6/bin/pg_controldata /var/lib/postgresql/9.6/main/` and outputs :

    pg_control version number:            960
